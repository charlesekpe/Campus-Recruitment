# Campus-Recruitment
Predicting whether a student will be placed based on various data about the student such as Gender, Work Experience.

This is one of my first Machine Learning projects and I was excited to get started. 
After preprocessing the data from Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv, I picked a Random Forest Classification model and train it using the data.
Created a cross_val_test function to test the accuracy of the model.
